OneForAll (OfA)
Whitepaper v1.0

Abstract
OneForAll (OfA) is a community-driven meme token built on the Binance Smart Chain. Our mission is to create a decentralized ecosystem where people can connect, support each other, and grow together. While OfA is primarily a meme token without an intrinsic financial utility, its true value lies in building a strong, passionate community and developing creative use cases that empower holders.
Mission & Vision
The mission of OneForAll is to establish a community token that unites individuals worldwide, allowing them to exchange ideas, support each other, and collectively grow. Inspired by the spirit of collaboration and empowerment, we aim to build a fun, engaging, and inclusive ecosystem that fosters trust and long-term community engagement.

Our vision is to transform OneForAll into more than just a meme token by introducing creative initiatives such as NFTs, DAOs, and future utilities that strengthen the bond among our community members.
